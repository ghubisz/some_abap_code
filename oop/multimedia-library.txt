Class hierarchy for a multimedia library. The hierarchy should include classes such as 'MediaItem', 'Movie' and 'AudioTrack'. Implement methods to add media items, search for media items and play media items.

CLASS MediaItem DEFINITION.
	PUBLIC SECTION.
		METHODS:
			constructor IMPORTING iv_title TYPE string iv_duration TYPE i,
			play.
	PRIVATE SECTION.
		DATA:
			title TYPE string,
			duration TYPE i.
ENDCLASS.

CLASS MediaItem IMPLEMENTATION.
	METHOD constructor.
		title = iv_title.
		duration = iv_duration.
	ENDMETHOD.
	
	METHOD play.
		WRITE: / 'Playing: ', title.
	ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.

CLASS Movie DEFINITION INHERITING FROM MediaItem.
	PUBLIC SECTION.
		METHODS:
			constructor IMPORTING iv_title TYPE string iv_duration TYPE i iv_director TYPE string,
			displayDetails.
	PRIVATE SECTION.
		DATA:
			director TYPE string.
ENDCLASS.

CLASS Movie IMPLEMENTATION.
	METHOD constructor.
		super -> constructor (iv_title = iv_title iv_duration = iv_duration).
		director = iv_director.
	ENDMETHOD.
	
	METHOD displayDetails.
		super -> play().
		WRITE: / 'Director: ', director.
	ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.

CLASS AudioTrack DEFINITION INHERITING FROM MediaItem.
	PUBLIC SECTION.
		METHODS:
			constructor IMPORTING iv_title TYPE string iv_duration TYPE i iv_artist TYPE string,
			displayDetails.
	PRIVATE SECTION.
		DATA: 
			artist TYPE string.
ENDCLASS.

CLASS AudioTrack IMPLEMENTATION.
	METHOD constructor.
		super -> constructor (iv_title = iv_title iv_duration = iv_duration).
		artist = iv_artist.
	ENDMETHOD.
	
	METHOD displayDetails.
		super ->play ().
		WRITE: / 'Artist: ', artist.
	ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.

DATA: mediaItems TYPE TABLE OF MediaItem,
			movie TYPE REF TO Movie,
			audioTrack TYPE REF TO AudioTrack.
			
CREATE OBJECT movie EXPORTING iv_title = 'The Avengers' iv_duration = 120 iv_director = 'Joss Whedon'.
CREATE OBJECT audioTrack EXPORTING iv_title = 'Bohemian Rhapsody' iv_duration = 300 iv_artist = 'Queen'.

mediaItems = VALUE #((movie) (audioTrack)).

LOOP AT mediaItems INTO DATA (mediaItem).
	mediaItem-> displayDetails().
ENDLOOP.
