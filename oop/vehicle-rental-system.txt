Class hierarchy for vehicle rental system. The hierarchy should include classes such as 'Vehicle', 'Car' and 'Motorcycle'. Implement methods to rent vehicles, calculate rental charges and display vehicle details.

CLASS Vehicle DEFINITION.
	PUBLIC SECTION.
		METHODS:
			constructor IMPORTING iv_make TYPE string iv_model TYPE string,
			displayDetails.
	PRIVATE SECTION.
		DATA:
			make TYPE string,
			model TYPE string.
ENDCLASS.

CLASS Vehicle IMPLEMENTATION.
	METHOD constructor.
		make = iv_make.
		model = iv_model.
	ENDMETHOD.
	
	METHOD displayDetails.
		WRITE: / 'Make: ', make.
		WRITE: / 'Model: ', model.
	ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.

CLASS Car DEFINITION INHERITING FROM Vehicle.
	PUBLIC SECTION.
		METHODS:
			constructor IMPORTING iv_make TYPE string iv_model TYPE string iv_seats TYPE i,
			displayDetails.
	PRIVATE SECTION.
		DATA:
			seats TYPE i.
ENDCLASS.

CLASS Car IMPLEMENTATION.
	METHOD constructor.
		super ->constructor (iv_make = iv_make iv_model = iv_model).
		seats = iv_seats.
	ENDMETHOD.
	
	METHOD displayDetails.
		super -> displayDetails().
		WRITE: / 'Number of Seats: ', seats.
	ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.

CLASS Motorcycle DEFINITION INHERITING FROM Vehicle.
		PUBLIC SECTION.
			METHODS:
				constructor IMPORTING iv_make TYPE string iv_model TYPE string iv_engineType TYPE string,
				displayDetails.
		PRIVATE SECTION.
			DATA:
				engineType TYPE string.
ENDCLASS.

CLASS Motorcycle IMPLEMENTATION.
	METHOD constructor.
		super -> constructor (iv_make = iv_make iv_model = iv_model).
		engineType = iv_engineType.
	ENDMETHOD.
	
	METHOD displayDetails.
		super -> displayDetails().
		WRITE: / 'Engine Type: ', engine Type.
	ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.
